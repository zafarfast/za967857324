# Professional README generator

## Description
An application that takes user input on a Node.js application and generates a README.md file for Github would be a command-line tool that prompts the user for information about their project, such as the project name, description, and installation instructions. The tool would then use that information to generate a README.md file with the appropriate formatting and content. The user could then upload the generated file to their Github repository. The tool could also include options for customizing the look and feel of the generated README, such as including a badge or adding a table of contents.
